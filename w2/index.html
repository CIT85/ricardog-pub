        <h3>But Why HTML?</h3>

        <p>HTML is a great language to learn, along with CSS for many reasons, among them include:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>HTML and CSS are beginner friendly, with relatively simple syntax I believe it is a good environment to start learning.
            </li>

            <li>
                There are a plethora of job opportunities available!
            </li>

            <li>
                HTML and CSS are excellent languages to begin your journey into the world of coding, learning first about front end web development, you may find yourself more curious about how the website handles and processes information like user accounts and passwords.
            </li>

            <li>If you enjoy designing and making things beautiful, or organized and efficient, then HTML and CSS are the languages for you! </li>

        <p><strong>Here are some tools I keep handy to get the job done right, maybe you'll find these useful enough to add to your own collection.</strong></p>

                <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">Chat GPT</a>

                <p>Chat GPT is like your own personal tutor or teacher, always do you own due dilligence in verifying the information it provides and learn how to ask it questions to maximize its usefulness. I personally believe AI models like Chat GPT will become an even larger part of our industry than it already has. </p>
