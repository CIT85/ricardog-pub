Certainly! Here are some ideas for a weightlifting-themed class project website that only uses HTML and CSS:

    Exercise Library: Create a page that showcases different weightlifting exercises. Each exercise could have its own section with a description, step-by-step instructions, and images demonstrating proper form. Use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it.

    Workout Plans: Design a page that offers various workout plans tailored for different fitness goals (e.g., strength-building, muscle gain, fat loss). Use HTML to lay out the plans and CSS to style them for readability and attractiveness.

    Progress Tracker: Develop a simple progress tracker where users can input their lifting stats (weights lifted, reps, sets) for different exercises. Use HTML forms and CSS styles to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

    Nutrition Tips: Create a section providing basic nutrition guidance for weightlifters, including suggested diets or meal plans. Use HTML for content and CSS to structure and style the information.

    Equipment Guide: Offer information about various weightlifting equipment (dumbbells, barbells, machines) with descriptions, images, and tips for usage. Organize this information using HTML and style it with CSS to make it visually engaging.

    Success Stories/Testimonials: Develop a section where users can share their weightlifting success stories or testimonials. Use HTML to structure the user-submitted content and CSS to format it nicely.

    FAQ Section: Create a frequently asked questions section where common weightlifting queries are addressed. Use HTML for question-and-answer pairs and CSS to make it easily readable.

    Responsive Design: Ensure that your website is responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Use CSS media queries to adjust layout and styles accordingly.
