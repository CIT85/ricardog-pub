                        <p class="paragraph-content">Bench pressing is a popular strength-training exercise where you lie on a bench and lift a barbell or dumbbells using your arms. The movement involves lowering the weights down towards your chest and then pushing them back up, straightening your arms. It mainly works out your chest, shoulders, and arms, helping to build upper body strength and muscle. How To Bench Press:</p>
                        <ol class="menu-list">
                            <li>Lie flat on a bench with your feet planted firmly on the ground.</li>
                            <li>Grip the barbell slightly wider that shoulder-width apart, lower it to your chest, and keep your elbows at around a 45-degree angle. </li>
                            <li>Push the barbell upward by extending your arms, exhaling as you lift. Keep your back flat against the bench.</li>
                            <li>Lower the barbell back to your chest in a controlled manner while inhaling.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Bend at your hips and slightly at the knees while keeping your back straight. Your torso should be almost parallel to the ground, and your arms should be fully extended toward the floor.</li>
                            <li>Keeping your core engaged, pull the barbell towards your lower chest by retracting your shoulder blades. Keep your elbows close to your body as you lift the weight.</li>
                            <li>Squeeze your back muscles at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position in a controlled manner.</li>
